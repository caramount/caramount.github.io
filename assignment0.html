<p>
	Why you are taking the class, what you hope to get out of it, and any particular topics you would like me to discuss:
	I took this class because I am interested in learning about various techniques used to create computer graphics. I look forward to experimenting with such techniques as the semester progresses and after it ends. I was not expecting to learn about virtual reality graphics but after the topic was introduced on the first day of class I'm eager to jump into it. I have a lot of experience using Unity so I'm glad we are using it to create the VR experiences. I also have access to a Google Cardboard so I'm excited by the idea of making something I could put on my iPhone and interact with using the Cardboard.</p>
